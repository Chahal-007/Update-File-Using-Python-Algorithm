# Update-File-Using-Python-Algorithm

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<P>In this project work,I will work with a text file that contains a series of IP addresses that can access restricted information. In this file, there are IP addresses that should no longer have access to restricted information, and those IP addresses must be removed. Python can automate this process of keeping files up-to-date through algorithms. </P>
<h2>Language and IDE</h2>
<p>Python</p>
<p>Pycharm</p>
<h2>Data Resources</h2>
<h5> Allowed_IP_List.txt  </h5>
<p>It contains a series of IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted information.</p>
<h5>Removed_IP_list</h5>
<p>It contains the list of IP addresses to be removed from the [Allowed_IP_List.txt].</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>In this lab, you're working as a security analyst and you're responsible for developing an algorithm that parses a file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted content and removes addresses that no longer have access.</p>
<h4>Task One: Display lists of all IP addresses are there and which needs to remove </h4>
